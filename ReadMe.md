# WestWind Wholesale

> Derived from the original *Northwind Traders*, this demo database maintains much of the original but includes additions/changes that allow the business to be imagined as a drop-shipping wholesaler. Also, dates have been bumped up by 20 years, to make it look a bit more "modern".
